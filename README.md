This is the FNSM app a.k.a the Friendly Neightborhood Spiderman app based off the one in the playstation spiderman miles morales game.
In the game it is used so citizens/fans are allowed to create a report so that spider man is able to help out.
I kept the same idea and added a third party api with general reports.
In the game it followed the Peter Parker theme but in my version I created a button that switched the themes and allows for a Miles Morales theme or Peter Parker theme.
